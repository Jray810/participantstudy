# Working on the Repository

This project was created with React. To run and work on it locally, first clone the repository, then navigate to the cloned repo and run `npm install` in the repository. If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed in advance, you should see the proper React libraries automatically installing.

Once installed, you can run `npm run start` to start a local development preview of the project in your local browser.

To save your code, follow normal `git commit` and `git push` procedures.

To deploy the website, run the command `npm run deploy` and it will automatically deploy to [https://jray810.github.io/participantstudy](https://jray810.github.io/participantstudy).
